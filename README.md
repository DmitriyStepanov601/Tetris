# Tetris

This application is an interpretation of the famous game Tetris.
"Tetris" is a puzzle based on the use of geometric shapes "tetramino" — a kind of polymino, consisting of four squares. Polyominoes in one form or another have been 
used in Board games and puzzles long before the creation of "Tetris".
Random tetramino figures fall from above into a rectangular glass 10 cells wide and 20 cells high. In flight, the player can rotate the figure 90 degrees and move 
it horizontally. You can also "reset" the figure, that is, accelerate its fall when it has already been decided where the figure should fall. The figure flies until 
it hits another figure or the bottom of the glass. If at the same time a horizontal row of 10 cells is filled, it disappears and everything above it falls by one cell. Additionally, the figure that will follow the current one is shown — this is a hint that allows the player to plan actions. The pace of the game gradually accelerates. 
The game ends when the new figure can't fit in the glass. The player gets points for each row filled, so his task is to fill the rows without filling the glass itself 
(vertically) for as long as possible, so as to get as many points as possible.
At the end, when the game is over, an inscription about the end of the game appears on the playing field with the output of the points scored and the best record.
